# Arithmetic Operations

PHP supports all sorts of native arithmetic operations. We'll go through the syntax below.

## Addition

```PHP
$sum = $number_1 + $number_2;
```

## Subtraction

```PHP
$difference = $number_1 - $number_2;
```

## Multiplication

```PHP
$product = $number_1 * $number_2;
```

## Exponentiation (Exponents)

```PHP
$exponent = $number_1 ** $number_2;
```

## Division

```PHP
$quotient = $number_1 / $number_2;
```

## Modulus (Remainder)

A modulus strictly gives whatever remains after a division operation (i.e. something is divided).

```PHP
$dividend = 5;
$divisor = 2;

$remainder = $dividend % $divisor; // 5 / 2 == 2.5; R = 1.
```
